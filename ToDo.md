ToDo:

1. figure out how to deal with updates to visualization functions (like curves) that are now within the big visualization rebuild function....
2. Make rebuild button pretty
3. make sure options drop-down remains centered at different screen sizes.
4. see if easy to filter on one item in one dimension before visualizing to lessen the clutter?
